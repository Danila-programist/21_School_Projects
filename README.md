## What is "School 21" from Sberbank?

School 21 is a free educational programming training program launched by Sberbank in cooperation with the French Programming School 42. This school is an unconventional learning format that focuses on practice and self-study.

## Features of the School 21:

- There are no teachers and lectures: Learning takes place through the implementation of real tasks and projects. Students learn by themselves and from each other using peer-to-peer learning methods.

- No grade points: There are no traditional exams or grades at School 21. A student's success is assessed by their ability to solve problems and create work projects.

- Flexible schedule: Students choose when and how much time they want to spend on studying.

- Without age and experience limits: The school is open to anyone who wants to study programming, regardless of age, education or work experience.

## Personal opinion

This training format is not suitable for everyone, but in my opinion I will say that there is nothing to do in programming without the possibility of self-study, mutual assistance with friends, self-control and dedication.

The school implies that the person who goes to study with them does not know how to program, but with zero knowledge
it will be very difficult, so training is necessary to successfully complete daily tasks.

In this section, I would like to demonstrate a set of just some of the difficult projects that I did on the Moscow campus of school 21 in the summer of 2024. I would like to note that the projects were made using the macOS operating system and written based on the C programming language. A limited time of two days was provided for each project.

#### Skills acquired while working with projects:
- writing the simplest bash scripts
- writing the simplest algorithms in the C language in a structured form
- modular work using Makefile
- working with data structures (singly linked list, stack, binary tree)
- working with files, including binary ones

#### List of interesting projects:
- the simplest implementation of long arithmetic 
- implementation of the simplest algorithms for finding the determinant, the inverse matrix, and the solution of SLOUGH 
- implementation of stack, singly linked list, binary tree 
- the game "Pong"
- the game "Life"
- the simplest implementation of Polish notation

I will also say that due to the limited project execution time, of course, it is possible
to improve and supplement the code.
